The [Trimesh Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/190sa3RhbzJ70SIRupHwt1KHrv6WGCr6b?usp=sharing) can be used to refer to the usage of Trimesh in the homework. You can also use the [Git Repo](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh) and the [documentation](https://trimsh.org/index.html) in case you need any further help. In this task, we will perform translational sweep of a polygon which we take as input (using a point file, attached in canvas). For the sake of this homework, we will assume that the polygon is convex.\n"
